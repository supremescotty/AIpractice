# AIpractice
A slightly more complex AI program that uses a machine learning algorithm to classify images of handwritten digits. I will use the popular MNIST dataset for training and testing the model. Here's an example using the scikit-learn library in Python.

Why?
Evaluation of the model: Calculating the accuracy allows us to assess the performance of the model on unseen data. It provides a quantitative measure of how well the model is able to classify the handwritten digits.

Performance comparison: Accuracy is a commonly used metric for classification tasks. It enables us to compare the performance of different models or variations of the same model. By tracking the accuracy over time, we can see if the model is improving or if any changes to the code or hyperparameters have positively or negatively affected the performance.

Model selection and optimization: Accuracy helps us select the best model among different algorithms or variations. It guides us in choosing the right hyperparameters or fine-tuning the model to achieve better results. By monitoring the accuracy, we can iterate and make improvements to enhance the model's performance.

Communication and reporting: Accuracy provides a concise summary of the model's performance. It allows us to communicate the effectiveness of the AI program to stakeholders, clients, or team members. Reporting the accuracy helps in conveying the model's reliability and can inform decision-making processes.
